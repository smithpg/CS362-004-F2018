/* -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Unit Test for the buyCard function 
 * 
 * The intended behavior for this function is as follows: 
 
-	 returns immediately without changing game state if it has been called during the wrong phase. 

-	 only allows a player to buy 1 card, or the number allowed by an action card played during the previous phase.

-	 does not add selected card to the playerâ€™s discard if there were none in the supply

-	 does not allow the player to buy a card they cannot afford

-    adds selected card to top of player's discard on successful buy
